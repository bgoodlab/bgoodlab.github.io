**Avaneesh Narla** <br/>
*Stanford Science Fellow*<br/>
<small>Avaneesh is a Stanford Science Fellow hosted by the Good and Fisher Labs. He is broadly interested in the dynamic adaptation of biological collectives. He is doing this in the context of microbial communities adapting to dynamic resource environments by studying the interplay of ecology and evolution, and in the context of social insects by studying collective behavior and decision-making in response to environmental changes.<br/>

**Jaime Lopez** <br/>
*Postdoctoral Fellow*<br/>
<small>Jaime is a postdoctoral fellow in the Good and Huang Labs. They carried out their PhD with Ned Wingreen and Mohamed Donia at Princeton, where they studied interactions between microbial communities and the chemical environments they inhabit. Jaimeâ€™s current research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage in the human gut microbiota.<br/>

**Daniel Wong** <br/>
*Graduate student in Applied Physics*<br/>
<small>Daniel received his B.A. in Physics from Williams College in 2017. He is currently investigating how interference between linked mutations impacts ecological diversification in evolving resource competition models. He is also developing tools for inferring short-term evolutionary forces in vivo using barcoded lineage tracking data. <br/>
