**Daniel Wong** <br/>
*Graduate student in Applied Physics*<br/>
Daniel received his B.A. in Physics from Williams College in 2017. He is currently investigating how interference between linked mutations impacts ecological diversification in evolving resource competition models. He is also developing tools for inferring short-term evolutionary forces in vivo using barcoded lineage tracking data. <br/>
