**Avaneesh Narla, PhD** <br/>
*Stanford Science Fellow*<br/>
<small>Avaneesh is a Stanford Science Fellow hosted by the Good and Fisher Labs. He is broadly interested in the dynamic adaptation of biological collectives. He is doing this in the context of microbial communities adapting to dynamic resource environments by studying the interplay of ecology and evolution, and in the context of social insects by studying collective behavior and decision-making in response to environmental changes.<br/>

**Jamie A. Lopez, PhD** <br/>
*Postdoctoral Fellow*<br/>
<small>Jamie is a postdoctoral fellow in the Good and Huang Labs. They carried out their PhD with Ned Wingreen and Mohamed Donia at Princeton, where they studied interactions between microbial communities and the chemical environment the microbes inhabit. Jamie’s current research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage in the human gut microbiota.<br/>

**Anastasia Lyulina** <br/>
*Graduate student in Biology*<br/>
<small>Anastasia is a graduate student in the Good and Petrov labs. She received her B.S. in Physics from Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University in 2017, and worked as research assistant in Fyodor Kondrashov's Evolutionary Genomics Group from 2017-2020. Anastasia's current work focuses on the patterns of genetic diversity that arise during selective sweeps.
