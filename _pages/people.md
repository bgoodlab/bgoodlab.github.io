**Daniel Wong** <br/>
*Graduate student in Applied Physics*<br/>
<small>Daniel received his B.A. in Physics from Williams College in 2017. He is currently investigating how interference between linked mutations impacts ecological diversification in evolving resource competition models. He is also developing tools for inferring short-term evolutionary forces in vivo using barcoded lineage tracking data. <br/>

**Anastasia Lyulina** <br/>
*Graduate student in Biology*<br/>
<small>Anastasia is a graduate student in the Good and Petrov labs. She received her B.S. in Physics from Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University in 2017, and worked as research assistant in Fyodor Kondrashov's Evolutionary Genomics Group from 2017-2020. Anastasia's current work focuses on the patterns of genetic diversity that arise during selective sweeps.
