Microbial communities drive important biochemical cycles, from the ocean to the soil to the human gut. Technological advances are revolutionizing our ability to peer into these evolving ecosystems, and to manipulate them experimentally. Yet a vast gap remains in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that shape their structure and function.

Our research aims to address this gap. **We use tools from statistical physics, population genetics, and computational biology to understand how growth processes and genome variability at the single-cell level give rise to the macroscopic behavior we observe at the population level.**

Research topics range from basic theoretical investigations of non-equilibrium stochastic processes in microbial evolution and ecology, to the development of new computational tools for measuring these processes *in situ* in both natural and experimental settings. We work closely with experimentalists, occasionally designing new experiments ourselves, and we also leverage the vast amounts of information contained in public sequencing repositories. **Through these specific examples, we seek to uncover unifying theoretical principles that could help us understand, forecast, and eventually control the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that take place in these diverse scenarios.**
